I just completed building this and have some addendum notes adding more details:
Install the following packages:
sudo apt-get install mpd
sudo apt-get install mpc
sudo apt-get install python-mpd
sudo apt-get install python-pyudev

(below assumes using defaults for /etc/mpd.conf)
sudo mkdir -p /music/usb
sudo ln -s /var/lib/mpd /music/mpd
sudo ln -s /var/lib/mpd/music /music/mp3

Copy the tobabp.py script to /home/pi
nano /home/pi/tobabp.py

Change these in the script or flip the connections in wiring diagram.
BUTTON = 17
LED = 24

Testing

Rename a USB stick to “1GB”
Copy 1 MP3 onto the stick

Insert the stick into pi
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /music/usb
sudo /etc/init.d/mpd stop
sudo rm /music/mp3/*
sudo cp /music/usb/* /music/mp3/
sudo umount /music/usb

Remove the USB stick
sudo rm /music/mpd/tag_cache
sudo /etc/init.d/mpd start
mpc clear
mpc ls
mpc ls | mpc add
sudo /etc/init.d/mpd restart
mpc play

Plug in earphones
You should hear audio

Next try the python script:
sudo python /home/pi/tobabp.py

Insert USB stick
the LED should flash and the USB file copy to /music/mp3/
the LED should flash again. Remove the Stick and LED flashes again.
Press button to start playing
Press button again to stop
Press & hold button to rewind to beginning.
sudo crontab -e
Add following line run at startup
@reboot python /home/pi/tobabp.py &
sudo reboot

Then retest again to be sure all is well.
